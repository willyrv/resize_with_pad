# Resize with padding
Resize images while keeping the aspect ratio by adding padding

This function is inspired from the one [here](https://gist.github.com/IdeaKing).
I added some modifications because the original ones does not fit all my
requirements.

The image for testing was taken from [here](https://github.com/lemire/kodakimagecollection/blob/master/kodim01.png)
